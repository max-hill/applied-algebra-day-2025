**Title:** Ultrafast learning of 4-node hybridization cycles using phylogenetic invariants

**Abstract:** The abundance of gene flow in the Tree of Life challenges the notion that evolution can be represented with a fully bifurcating process which cannot capture important biological realities like hybridization, introgression, or horizontal gene transfer. Coalescent-based network methods are increasingly popular, yet not scalable for big data, because they need to perform a heuristic search in the space of networks as well as numerical optimization that can be NP-hard. Here, we introduce a novel method to reconstruct phylogenetic networks based on algebraic invariants. While there is a long tradition of using algebraic invariants in phylogenetics, our work is the first to define phylogenetic invariants on concordance factors (frequencies of four-taxon splits in the input gene trees) to identify level-1 phylogenetic networks under the multispecies coalescent model. Our novel hybrid detection methodology is optimization-free as it only requires the evaluation of polynomial equations, and as such, it bypasses the traversal of network space, yielding a computational speed at least 10 times faster than the fastest-to-date network methods. We illustrate our methodâ€™s performance on simulated and real data from the genus Canis. We present an open-source publicly available Julia package PhyloDiamond.jl with broad applicability within the evolutionary community.
